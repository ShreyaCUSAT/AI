Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning for paradigms for Autonomous cars
Abstract of Research Article under review:
Artificial intelligence has witnessed significant attention from both
research and industry in recent years. Artificial intelligence is not a
new area of research, and research in this field has been reported over
decades since 1950 on a continuous basis. Renewed interest in this
stream of computing has been primarily due to development of path
breaking methodologies which have potential application in various
industries including automotive. The buildup of research in the area of
artificial intelligence over the past sixty years and the general viability
of application of the past and on-going research especially in the area
of automotive is the motivation behind this work. However there are
still important gaps that need to the bridged to make it possible to
develop truly general as well as adaptive intelligent machines with
application to the automotive sector. The article is an effort to point out
that a meaningfully useful general learning machine must not only be
“general” that it is able to learn and solve various types of problems
encountered in the automotive domain, but also be able to learn
quickly in an constantly changing, chaotic environment e,g. general
traffic in India. The article reviews the present limitations of industry-
accepted AI based learning methodologies which have the potential to
fill the gaps. A paradigm related to deep thinking and deep learning is
discussed that has the potential to give a future direction to research to
put forth truly general and adaptive intelligent machines.
